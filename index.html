          <h1>Bruce Wesley Arden</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Bruce Wesley Arden</strong> (May 29, 1927 – December 8, 2021) was an American computer scientist.
            Arden enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II (1944-1946) as a Radar Technician Third Class in
            California, Chicago, and Kodiak, Alaska. He graduated from Purdue University with a BS(EE) in 1949 and began
            his computing career in 1950 with the wiring and programming of IBM's hybrid Card Programmed
            Computer/Calculator at the Allison Division of General Motors. He later worked as a programmer at the
            University of Michigan's Willow Run Laboratory.

          <h2>Compiler Development</h2>
          <p>
            Arden became a research associate at the University of Michigan's Statistical Research Laboratory and later
            associate director of the university's Computing Center. He co-authored two compilers: GAT for the IBM 650
            and MAD for the IBM 704/709/7090.

          <h2>Virtual Memory and System Design</h2>
          <p>
            Arden contributed to the design and architecture of the IBM System/360 Model 67 computer, focusing on
            virtual memory features, and was involved in the initial design of the Michigan Terminal System (MTS)
            time-sharing operating system.
