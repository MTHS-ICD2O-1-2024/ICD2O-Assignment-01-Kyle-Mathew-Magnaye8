    <p>
      Bruce Wesley Arden (May 29, 1927 – December 8, 2021) was an American
      computer scientist. Arden enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II
      (1944-1946) as a Radar Technician Third Class in California, Chicago, and
      Kodiak, Alaska. He graduated from Purdue University with a BS(EE) in 1949
      and started his computing career in 1950 with the wiring and programming
      of IBM's hybrid (mechanical and electronic) Card Programmed
      Computer/Calculator at the Allison Division of General Motors. Next he
      spent a short period as a programmer for computations being done at the
      University of Michigan's Willow Run Laboratory using the Standards Eastern
      Automatic Computer.

      <h2>Academic Leadership</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Arden's increasing interest in academic computer science and engineering
      motivated him to complete a doctoral program in electrical engineering in
      1965. He was subsequently a professor in, and ultimately chairman of, the
      Computer and Communication Sciences department at Michigan. In 1973 he
      accepted a professorship at Princeton University and chaired the
      department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In 1986, then
      Princeton's Alexander Doty Professor of Engineering, he went to the
      University of Rochester as its dean of the College of Engineering and
      Applied Science. In the three years preceding the addition of "Emeritus"
      to his academic title (William May Professor of Engineering) in 1995, he
      also served as Rochester's vice provost for telecommunications and
      computing.

    <p>
      During his academic career, Arden wrote two books on numerical computation
      and edited another on computer science and engineering research. He wrote
      many papers in the areas of compilers, operating systems, computer logic
      and networks.

      In addition, he supervised many students, both undergraduate and graduate,
      in their studies of the various aspects of computing, and he served as a
      consultant to government agencies and several major computer companies at
      various times during those years. He retired in 1995 and lived in Michigan
